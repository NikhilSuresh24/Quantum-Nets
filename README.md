# Quantum-Nets
Quantum algorithm that generates a quantum circuit that simulates a Kauffman NK Model

Checkout [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/introduction.html) for a quantum information library and explanation of the fundamentals of quantum computing

Take a look at this [repository](https://github.com/waddlepon/neuro-comp-bio.git) for a classical NK model
